The ui_one prototype was an initial effort to work through the configuration and setup of a Rust program using the imgui-rs crate, and to create a window with a simple panel-oriented UI. Initially, the program displayed a single button. This expanded in a series of experiments to include multiple buttons with different behaviors, and eventually display a flashing red dot that orbited in a circle. It was a learning experience, and has been preserved here only as a historical (or perhaps hysterical) artifact.
