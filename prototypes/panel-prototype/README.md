The panel-prototype was a proof-of-concept to try to recreate a UI similar to the Elliott 503's operator panel and display of a simple counting register. It also includes a couple of experiments with immediate-mode rendering, including the console clock, which was not present on the 503's panel.

Internally, this prototype also saw the development of initial UI widgets for buttons and lamps, plus an initial implementation of a Register struct for eventual use within the emulator to maintain register state and compute average lamp intensities for each bit.
